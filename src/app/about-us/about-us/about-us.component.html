      A Forum is a place for discussion.A council is a group of people who come together to consult, deliberate, or make
      decisions.
      A council may function as a legislature, especially at a town, city or county/shire level, but most legislative
      bodies at the state or national level are not considered councils.
      At such levels, there may be no separate executive branch, and the council may effectively represent the entire
      government.
      A board of directors might also be denoted as a council. A committee might also be denoted as a council, though a
      committee is generally a subordinate body composed of members of a larger body, while a council may not be.
      Because many schools have a student council, the council is the form of governance with which many people are
      likely to have their first experience as electors or participants.
